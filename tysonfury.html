          <p>
            Tyson Fury is one of the greatest heavyweight boxers in the world.
            Although he has had very tough fights against very good boxers his
            biggest battle was against depression and to overcome suicidal
            thoughts. After his fight against Wladimir Klitschko in 2015, Tyson
            did not want to fight at all and loss all motivation to ever step
            in the boxing ring again because he achieved his lifelong dream ever
             since he was a kid to beat Wladimir.

          <h3>The Road to Rock Bottom</h3>
          <p>
            After Tyson Fury beat Klitschko, he lost his boxing championship
            belt since he was supposed to fight Klitschko again as it was in his
             contract that he signed but it never amounted to anything. Tyson
             was so obsessed with his lifelong dream of beating Klitschko that
             once he beat him, he did not have anything to do with his life. He
             never thought of what he was going to do after the biggest win of
             his career. Tyson Fury started going to the pub and start drinking
             as many as 20 pints of beer in one go as well as go on several
             eating marathons. Tyson also started taking illegal substance such
             as Class A drugs and recreational drugs. Under the influence of
             alcohol Tyson used to feel like he was on top of the world and
             thought of himself as the best boxer in the world. Once he was in a
              state of consciousness, he would be depressed and lost all
              motivation to do anything in life.

          <h3>Suicidal Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            Tyson Fury’s mental condition deteriorated to the point that he
            wanted to kill himself. Tyson Fury talked to his father as to how he
             felt and consulted one of the best clinical psychologists in UK.
             Tyson explained his situation to his doctor. The doctor had a one
             on one conversation with his father and said that Tyson should have
              been dead a long time ago but there is something that is keeping
              him alive and that he shouldn’t be left alone as he could commit
              suicide anytime. Due to Tyson an excessive amount of alcohol as
              well as eating a large amount of junk food, he amassed a
              staggering 400 lbs. Tyson recalls that one night after coming back
               home he went to his room and started crying and his t-shirt
               became wet because of all the tears and he just prayed to god
               that he doesn’t die, that prayer gave him hope. After ten minutes
                or so, he went to the kitchen to talk to his wife and told his
                wife that from the next day he is going to go on a run and turn
                his life around. At first his wife did not think much of as
                Tyson would say it every time he came back home after a night
                out but afterwards she felt something different in his voice
                when he said it.

          <h3>The Rise</h3>
          <p>
            Tyson started to gain his life back and got a new gym to train in as
             well as new coaches and a new promoter. He set goals for himself
             such as losing weight and start boxing again. At first Tyson
             struggled to keep up but after a couple weeks training felt like a
             breeze and his psychologist deemed him medically fit to fight. He
             got his boxing license back and got clear of all the lawsuits
             against him such as doping and PEDs allegations that were put
             against him. He started fighting again and was booked for a mega
             fight against Deontay Wilder only in his third fight back. He got
             brutally got knocked down in that fight but got back up and the
             first of three fights between the two ended in a draw. Tyson would
             go onto win the next two fights against Deontay and would self as
             the greatest of all time.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Even a man as big and as fierce as Tyson Fury can go through
            depression. You are not alone. Tyson Fury has shared his fury and
            overcame depression by setting goals for himself to accomplish and
            he stayed motivated to accomplish those goals
