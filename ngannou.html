          <p>
            Francis Ngannou is the one of the world’s best MMA fighters in the
            world. He is currently the UFC heavyweight champion of the world,
            which he won against a UFC veteran Stipe Miocic. Although his rise
            in the UFC has been astronomical, it was not all glitz and glamour
            for the champ.

          <h3>Childhood</h3>
          <p>
            Francis was born and brought up in Cameroon. To say that he had a
            very tough childhood is an understatement. It wasn’t easy growing up
             for him, since his parents got divorced which was very hard for him
             mentally and he was forced to live with his mom due to his
             father’s domestic violence. Unlike most kids, Francis started
             working at the age of 10 in one of the most physically intensive
             jobs, sand mining. It was because of this that Francis developed a
             good physique and strength. Francis used to work on weekends and
             during holidays for a little amount of money. He recalls that while
              other kids were going on a vacation to their relative’s house, he
              used to be working to support his family.  It was so bad that
              sometimes Francis wouldn’t have school supplies to write on, so
              he would find empty sheets of paper from his old copybooks to
              write on which often led to him getting into arguments with his
              teachers and often getting kicked out of the class. His mother was
               informed about his “behaviour”, but she couldn’t do anything as
               she couldn’t afford to buy him new school supplies. Due to
               financial problems, Francis had to drop out of school as he
               couldn’t pay his school fees. He was really interested into
               boxing but people around him used to discourage him saying that
               he would get fatal brain injuries such as Parkinson’s or Brain
               heamorrage. He still believed in his dream but he just kept it to
                himself.

          <h3>Death of A Loved One</h3>
          <p>
            Although his father was a bad person, there were some good things
            about his father. His father got a terrible illness which was
            getting worse day by day and Francis couldn’t take him to the
            hospital as he wasn’t financially stable enough up to do so. This
            ultimately led to his father’s death which made him think that his
            father was dying and he couldn’t do anything about it. He started
            wondering what would happen if anything like that happened to his
            mother, would he be able to save her. Due to his father’s death, he
            decided to get out of Africa and travel to a place which had more
            opportunities in combat sports.

          <h3>The Journey</h3>
          <p>
            In his early/mid 20’s Francis decided to travel to Nigeria. During
            his last few weeks in Cameroon Francis was very emotional taking it
            all in as it might be the last time he ever sees Cameroon, if things
             don’t go right for him on his journey. Francis had to swallow his
             money because of the gangs and criminals, along the route to
             Nigeria, would take anything of value from the people travelling.
             After spending some time in Nigeria, Francis stood on the side of a
              truck which would carry illegal immigrants like him through the
              Sahara Desert to Algeria. Francis regarded this as the toughest
              part of his so called trip because standing on the side of a
              moving vehicle going 120 kmph is very dangerous and could result
              in death if you let go of your grip. Francis had made it safely
              to Algeria at this point and traded his money in exchange for the
              Algerian currency to buy a fake Mali passport since Mali had a
              good relationship with Algeria. He would then proceed with his
              journey to Morocco as it was the nearest country to Europe.
              Francis stayed in Morocco for a while trying to figure out a way
              to reach Spain. He used to stay in a forest near border control
              taking not of what type of technology they to use and how to
              bypass it to begin his new life. Francis and a couple of other
              immigrants put together some money to buy a raft and covered it
              with aluminum to bypass the radar. Unfortunately, they got caught
              by the Moroccan police and they were left in the desert once again
              to suffer after the police were done with them. Francis was
              unsuccessful for his next 7 tries to reach Spain and ended up in
              the desert each time. He was beginning to lose hope, but he came
              so far so he thought why not give it another try. Alas, He was
              successful with his fellow immigrants. Once he was in Spain he
              contacted the Red Crescent organization for food and water.
              After wards, he was held in a detention center for coming to the
              country illegally and was facing trial with an attorney as his
              only defendant. Francis recalled the detention center as very
              boring as if it was slowly killing you. Once he got out of jail,
              he would travel to a small town near Paris, France. He would sleep
               in an underground parking lot and during the day he would try to
               find a nearby gym to train in.

          <h3>The Beginning of an Era</h3>
          <p>
            Francis finally found a boxing gym, but he couldn’t afford it, so he
             asked the receptionist to talk to the coach. After explaining his
             story to the coach, the coach handed him 50 euros and told him to
             start training from the upcoming Sunday. Francis used the money to
             buy sports equipment and was very excited for his first training
             session. During the winter holiday, the gym was supposed to close
             down for renovations and during that time one of his teammates at
             the gym told Francis to start MMA but he refused. With the holidays
              coming up and Francis having nothing to do, he decided to
              volunteer for a charity to help other people in need just
              like him. Francis would still have a long time to kill even after,
               coincidentally there was an MMA gym right next to the charity he
               volunteered for. Francis reconsidered his decision and decided to
                try it out. Within 4 months, Francis won his first professional
                MMA fight and the rest was history. He would then go onto win
                many more fights and beat Stipe Miocic for the UFC heavyweight
                Championship. He recently beat his former teammate, Ciryl Gane,
                to retain his belt. With one fight left on his UFC contract, he
                has expressed interet to fight Tyson Fury in a boxing match.
